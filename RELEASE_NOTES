February 21, 2013 Emanuel Jacobi  (emanuel.jacobi@desy.de)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Release V00-06-00

- Nest headings in docs properly
- Consolide CMakeLists.txt
- Removed dependency on log4cplus
- Remove photo2numpy. It is now obsolete, having been replaced by the
  standalone python reader.
- Add dependency on IceTray to support the new unit test infrastructure
  -- Nathan Whitehorn

- Add write support to C-side splinetable.
- Improved documentation
- Expose table dimensionality and extent in I3SplineTable.
- Make I3SplineTable const-correct and aware of the BIAS field.
- Make C library functions const-correct.
- Remove a stray knot shift. This was a small effect for Photonics tables
  (1 degree in zenith and 1 meter in depth), but has been wrong since
  before the initial commit.
  -- Jakob van Santen

- Cleaned up warnings generated by clang
  -- Kevin Meagher


September 11, 2012 Emanuel Jacobi  (emanuel.jacobi@desy.de)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Release V00-05-00

- Make plots look nicer, with colors, correct axes, ...
- Reformulate the entry to the outer loop of BLOCK3 to avoid spurious
  early termination.
    In the previous version of the initilization, we started by solving
    the unconstrained problem and projecting the solution into the x>=0
    space. The first operation in the other loop is to check the Lagrange
    multipliers associated with the constrained coefficients and free any
    whose nonzeroness would reduce the residual. In certain cases where a
    very small penalty term was used, it could happen that all elements of y
    were nonnegative, causing the outer loop to terminate with a truncated
    solution that did not correspond to the minimum in the subspace of
    the free coefficients. Starting with the null vector instead of the
    truncated solution to the unconstrained problem keeps the state of the
    factorization consistent with the rest of the outer loop, and makes this
    behavior go away.
- Shift time knots to start from 1 ns instead of 0.1 ns
- Replace photoadd with something that actually works.
- Fix an off-by-2 bug in standalone reader.
  -- Jakob van Santen

- Fixed small bug in reading spline header in python. Now, spline.geotype
  actually returns the geotype, and spline.level actually returns the level
  -- Jake Feintzeig


June 25, 2012 Emanuel Jacobi  (emanuel.jacobi@desy.de)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Release V00-04-00

- Rototill photospline code to get the geometry lookup class (point
  source vs. infinite muon for now) from the table headers instead of
  guessing from the look-up particle type.
- Make the photonics-dependent parts conditional on the
  presence of photonics
- Add an experimental non-recursive BLAS-based ndsplineeval()
- Remove localbasis_sub()
  -- Nathan Whitehorn

- Condense photo2numpy from 500 lines of C to 60 lines of Python
  -- Jakob van Santen

- Silence warnings in clang
- removed an unused variable from cholesky_solve
  -- Claudio Kopper



January 11, 2012 Emanuel Jacobi  (emanuel.jacobi@desy.de)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Release V00-03-00

Features:
- Added support for Ngroup
   -- Jacob Feintzeig
- Read reference index of refraction from Photonics tables
  -- Jakob van Santen

Bugfixes:
- Build photo2numpy unconditionally
- Allow use of non-spglam components if spglam is not built
- Check if level2 support exists
- Handle missing numpy gracefully
- Synchronize nnls_lawson_hanson() with wavedeform and millipede
  -- Nathan Whitehorn


August 9, 2011 Emanuel Jacobi  (emanuel.jacobi@desy.de)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Release V00-02-00

Features:
- Updated the version of Lawson-Hanson
- Reduced the effects of autocorrelation by thinning
  the sampled points by the burnin period.
  -- Nathan Whitehorn
- utils.py works with level1 and level2 tables
  -- Jacob Feintzeig


April 15, 2011, Fabian Kislat  (fabian.kislat@desy.de)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Release V00-01-00. Initial release.
